waiting for further updates...

# MODEL UPDATED

## Gather training data

Required

- [ ] image set shall be greater than 20000.
- [ ] image set shall based on different epochs.
- [ ] image set shall contain different races in public space.

## Train the model

### Path A

Get pre-trained model for gray scale images for race identification.

- [ ] find model with accuracy greater than 98%.
- [ ] find model capable of processing gray-scale images.

### Path B

Train model by yourself.

- [ ] find reliable architecture (current best CNNs)
- [ ] find dataset and train the models for race identificaton (Unconstrained) <- This worth a CS graduates final paper, lol.

## Reach conclusion

- [ ] Ask Gary.
